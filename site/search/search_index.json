Features Simple deployment model Dashboarding metrics, logs, and healthchecks Integrates with ChatOps tools - Slack, PagerDuty etc. Highly efficient metrics collection and storage Domain aware functionalities, including Cassandra repairs and backups. Components AxonOps has four main components: axon-server - The main server of axonops that collect metrics, logs, events and more. axon-agents - They corresponds to small binaries deployed onto the nodes of your clusters. axon-dash - The UI to interact with axon-server (dash for AxonOps Dashboards).
