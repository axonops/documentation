# Point in Time Recovery

The aim of the AxonOps Cassandra Commitlog Archiving(PITR) feature is to provide an easy to use graphical user interface instead of users having to configure it manually on every Cassandra node in a cluster.

#### Features

- UI to configure Commitlog archiving per Data Center(DC) in your cluster.
- UI that uses backups and commitlogs to specify the Point-in-Time to restore your cluster state too. 
- UI for for viewing current commitlog archiving status.
- Local or Remote Storage locations to store your commitlog archives.
- Retention periods for how long to keep your commitlog archives.


#### Understanding Commitlog Archiving

In Apache Cassandra, the commitlog is a vital component of the database that records every write operation before it is applied to the data files (SSTables). 
This mechanism ensures durability and helps recover data in case of a node failure.

Commitlog Archiving takes this a step further by continuously saving these logs to a secure location. This process involves:

  - **```Capturing Every Change```**
  
    Every modification to the database, including inserts, updates, and deletions, is recorded in the commitlog.

  - **```Archiving Logs```**
  
    These logs are periodically copied to an external storage location, creating a history of all database operations.

  - **```Ensuring Data Durability```**
  
    In the event of a hardware failure or data corruption, the archived commitlogs can be used to reconstruct the state of the database.

This archiving process is essential for maintaining data integrity, enabling disaster recovery, and supporting compliance with data retention policies.

#### Point-in-Time Restore (PITR)

Point-in-Time Restore (PITR) is a powerful feature that allows you to restore your database to a specific moment in time.
This is particularly useful for recovering from data corruption, accidental deletions, or other operational errors.

Here’s how PITR works in Apache Cassandra:

  - **```Continuous Archiving```**

    As mentioned, commitlogs are continuously archived, creating a comprehensive record of all database operations.

  - **```Restore Process```**

    When a restore is needed, the archived commitlogs are replayed from the last known good snapshot up to the desired point in time. This involves:

    - **```Stopping the Database:```** Halting operations to ensure data consistency.
    - **```Applying Logs:```** Reapplying the archived commitlogs to reconstruct the database state up to the specified timestamp.
    - **```Restarting Operations:```** Bringing the database back online, now restored to the desired point in time.

PITR is invaluable for maintaining business continuity and minimizing data loss in critical situations.
It provides a granular level of control over data recovery, allowing enterprises to revert their databases to any precise moment before an issue occurred.

#### Why Commitlog Archiving and PITR Matter

Commitlog archiving and PITR are not just advanced database features; they are essential tools for enterprise-grade data management. They ensure that:
  - **```Data Integrity```**
  
    Your data remains accurate and consistent, even in the face of failures.

  - **```Disaster Recovery```**
  
    You can recover quickly from unforeseen disasters with minimal data loss.

  - **```Regulatory Compliance```**
  
    You meet stringent data retention and auditing requirements.

  - **```Operational Resilience```**
  
    You can handle accidental data modifications or deletions without significant downtime.

#### The Traditional Challenges of Cassandra Commitlog Archiving and Point-in-Time Restore

Typically, setting up Commitlog Archiving and Point-in-Time Restore in Cassandra is a complex and time-consuming process. 
It involves configuring various components, ensuring compatibility between different systems, and maintaining an intricate setup that can often be fragile and prone to errors.
These configurations require in-depth knowledge and continuous monitoring to ensure everything runs smoothly.
