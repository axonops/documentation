# Why we built AxonOps™ Workbench for Apache Cassandra®?

The team at AxonOps has a deep appreciation for Apache Cassandra. It's an exceptional database, offering unparalleled performance and availability, built on robust distributed system principles. This makes Cassandra the go-to choice for always-on, always-available, highly performant, and modern databases tailored for cloud, hybrid, and internet-facing enterprises.

We initially developed the AxonOps platform to provide the essential operational tools needed to monitor, maintain, and protect Cassandra deployments. However, we recognized a significant gap in the market: the lack of a high-quality desktop application specifically designed for Cassandra. 

While there have been some attempts to create such tools over the years, they often fell short. Many were not built natively for Cassandra, relying instead on JDBC connections or just as plugins for other tools. Additionally, these tools were often poorly maintained or closed-source, limiting their usability and adaptability for the Cassandra community. 

Unlike other databases, Cassandra has had a very limited selection of dedicated desktop applications, and we believed it was time to change that. We wanted to provide a tool that matched the quality and usability of desktop applications available for other databases. Thus, we created AxonOps Workbench to make it easier for developers and DBAs to connect to, use, develop, and administer Cassandra through an intuitive and modern desktop application.

AxonOps Workbench is fully open-source, licensed under the Apache License, and we warmly welcome your feedback and contributions. Just as we built AxonOps to simplify the administration and monitoring of Cassandra, we have now built AxonOps Workbench to offer a seamless and efficient experience for directly connecting to and working with Cassandra.

## AI Capabilities

AxonOps Workbench also incorporates advanced AI capabilities to further enhance the user experience. Our AI assistant is designed to provide intelligent support, allowing users to ask questions and receive immediate, context-aware responses. This feature leverages machine learning algorithms to offer insights, optimize queries, and provide recommendations based on the specific needs of your Cassandra clusters.

The AI assistant can help with a variety of tasks, from simple query formulation to complex troubleshooting, making it an invaluable tool for both novice and experienced users. By integrating AI, AxonOps Workbench not only simplifies database management but also empowers users to make more informed decisions, ultimately improving the efficiency and performance of their Apache Cassandra deployments.
