# Kafka Topics

## What is a topic

A Kafka topic is a core concept in Apache Kafka, serving as a logical channel or category where data streams are organized and managed. Producers write (publish) messages to topics, and consumers read (subscribe) to messages from topics. Topics decouple producers from consumers, enabling scalable and real-time data pipelines

- Naming: Topics are named to reflect the data they contain, such as temperature_readings or user_activity.

- Decoupling: Producers and consumers operate independently, using the topic as an intermediary.

- Retention: Kafka retains messages in a topic for a configurable period (default is 7 days), regardless of whether they have been consumed.

- Partitions: Each topic is split into one or more partitions. Partitions allow Kafka to scale horizontally and enable parallel processing. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records, and each record within a partition has a unique offset.

- Replication: Partitions are replicated across multiple brokers for fault tolerance. Each partition has a leader (handles reads/writes) and followers (replicate data for redundancy).
