# Data Distribution

For detailed information about data distribution, see [Distributed Data](distributed-data/index.md).

This section covers how Cassandra distributes data across the cluster:

- [Partitioning](distributed-data/partitioning.md) - How data is partitioned across nodes
- [Replication](distributed-data/replication.md) - How data is replicated for fault tolerance
- [Consistency](distributed-data/consistency.md) - Consistency levels and guarantees
