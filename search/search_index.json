You can verify if you're already good to go with the following commands: .. --version # ... 2.7.13 ... --version # ... 9.0.1 Installing and verifying AxonOps Server is as simple as: apt-get install axonops axonops --version # axonops, version 0.17.1 AxonOps Server requires Agent = 0.17.1. Installing Agent using apt-get Agent can be installed with apt-get : apt-get install java-agent using other methods you're on Windows you can use Link to install Method : apt-get install axonops-server This will install all required dependencies like something and something else . cloning from GitHub AxonOps Server can also be used without a system-wide installation by cloning the repository into a subfolder of your project's root directory: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/axonops.git This is especially useful if you want to extend the app and override some parts of the app. The app will reside in the folder path-to/folder . Troubleshooting Installation on macOS When you're running the pre-installed version of Python on macOS,, axonops tries to install packages in a folder for which your user might not have the adequate permissions. There are two possible solutions for this: Installing in user space (recommended): Provide the --user flag to the install command and axonops will install the package in a user-site location. This is the recommended way. Switching to a homebrewed Python : Upgrade your Python installation to a self-contained solution by installing Python with Homebrew. This should eliminate a lot of problems you may be having with axonops . Error: unrecognized theme 'axonops' If you run into this error, the most common reason is that you installed AxonOps Server through some package manager (e.g. Homebrew or apt-get ) and the Material theme through pip , so both packages end up in different locations. AxonOps only checks its install location for themes. Alternative: Using Docker If you're familiar with Docker, the official Docker image for Material comes with all dependencies pre-installed and ready-to-use with the latest version published on PyPI, packaged in a very small image. Pull it with: docker pull squidfunk/mkdocs-material The axonops executable is provided as an entrypoint, serve is the default command. Start the development server in your project root with: docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material If you're using Windows command prompt ( cmd.exe ), substitute ${PWD} with \"%cd%\" . Usage In order to run axonops server just add one of the following lines to your project's config.yml . If you installed Axonops using a package manager: MQTT : endpoints : RESTConfig : host : 0.0.0.0 port : 8080 elastic_host : localhost elastic_port : 9200 alerting : notification_interval : 3h notification_endpoints : axonops_host : http://localhost:3000/ axonops_logo : https://digitalis.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/slack_axonops.png axonops_website : https://www.axonops.com/ backup : localRetentionDurationDays : 30 Axonops server includes a development server, so you can review your changes as you go. The development server can be started with the following command: ./axonops Now you can point your browser to http://localhost:3000 and the Material theme should be visible. From here on, you can start writing your documentation, or read on and customize the theme. Configuration Color palette A default hue is defined for every primary and accent color on Google's Material Design [color palette][10], which makes it very easy to change the overall look of the theme.
